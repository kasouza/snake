# Play it yourself
Donwload this project and open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser!
It should work on any modern browser.

# How to play!
Use the arrows to move and `p` to pause.

# The code
If you're interested in the code, it's just vanilla javascript. In this project I tried to make everything using mostly ES6 classes and kinda liked the result!
It should be fairly easy to read and understand the code.

Anyway, hope you liked it!
